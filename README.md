What is doubly linked list? What is advantages and disadvantages of it?

A doubly linked list is a type of linked list where each node contains a data element and two pointers that point to the next and previous nodes in the sequence. This structure allows traversal of the list in both forward and backward directions.

Features of a Doubly Linked List:
Bidirectional Traversal: Each node has a pointer to the next and previous nodes, enabling traversal in both directions.
Insertion and Deletion: Adding or removing elements from a doubly linked list can be more efficient than a singly linked list since it can be done without traversing the entire list.
Memory Overhead: The extra pointer in each node increases the memory overhead compared to a singly linked list.
Advantages of Doubly Linked Lists:
Bidirectional Traversal: Provides the ability to navigate the list in both forward and backward directions.
Efficient Insertion and Deletion: Insertion and deletion operations at both ends and in the middle of the list can be more efficient compared to singly linked lists.
Disadvantages of Doubly Linked Lists:
Increased Memory Overhead: The extra pointer in each node increases the memory overhead compared to singly linked lists.
Complexity: Maintaining the links between nodes adds complexity to the implementation and can potentially lead to more errors.
Doubly linked lists are commonly used in scenarios where efficient bidirectional traversal and frequent insertions and deletions are required.


what is singley linked list??
A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science and programming. It consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one in the sequence.

Structure:-
Each element in a singly linked list is called a node.
Each node contains two fields: data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
Characteristics:-
It is a linear data structure.
It is dynamic in nature, meaning elements can be added or removed easily.
It does not have a fixed size, unlike arrays.
Operations:-
Insertion: Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or middle of the list.
Deletion: Removing a node from the list.
Traversal: Accessing each node in the list sequentially.
Searching: Finding a specific element in the list.
Advantages:-
Efficient insertion and deletion operations, especially at the beginning of the list.
Dynamic size.
Disadvantages:-
Inefficient random access, as elements can only be accessed sequentially.
Requires more memory than arrays due to the overhead of storing the next node reference.
Singly linked lists are commonly used as the underlying data structure for other abstract data types such as stacks, queues, and graphs.
