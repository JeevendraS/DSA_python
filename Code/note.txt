what is list?
list is  a linear collection of data items also known as list Item.

what is singley linked list??
A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science and programming. It consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one in the sequence.

Structure
Each element in a singly linked list is called a node.
Each node contains two fields: data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
Characteristics
It is a linear data structure.
It is dynamic in nature, meaning elements can be added or removed easily.
It does not have a fixed size, unlike arrays.
Operations
Insertion: Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or middle of the list.
Deletion: Removing a node from the list.
Traversal: Accessing each node in the list sequentially.
Searching: Finding a specific element in the list.
Advantages
Efficient insertion and deletion operations, especially at the beginning of the list.
Dynamic size.
Disadvantages
Inefficient random access, as elements can only be accessed sequentially.
Requires more memory than arrays due to the overhead of storing the next node reference.
Singly linked lists are commonly used as the underlying data structure for other abstract data types such as stacks, queues, and graphs.
